Crystal Palace Park is home to the world's first dinosaur theme park, designed and sculpted by Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins in 1852\.

Crystal Palace National Sports Centre (Crystal Palace NSC) is also located within the park grounds and includes the listed building housing the Olympic sized swimming pool and squash courts and the Athletics Stadium used for Crystal Palace Athletics.

Crystal Palace Bowl is on the eastern side of the park and is used for outdoor concerts and slightly further up on the top of the hill is London's second highest landmark, the Crystal Palace Television Transmitter.

A proposal for construction of a Multiplex Cinema based on the top site of the park was defeated in May 2001\. The redevelopment of the park is still under discussion - previous talks organised by the LDA resulted in a Masterplan being approved but they have subsequently withdrawn from taking over the park and doing any work.
